    "A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.\n",

    " Heaps can be of two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s    children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s    children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representation of the heap using list is same as we store binary tree in list. root at 0th index, left node at \n",
