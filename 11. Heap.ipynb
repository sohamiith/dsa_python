    "A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a complete tree (All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible)\n",
    "\n",
    " Heaps can be of two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s    children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s    children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications:\n",
    "1. Heap sort\n",
    "2. Priority queue\n",
    "3. Graph algorithems (Dijkstra,prim's)\n",
    "4. merge K sorted array\n",
    "5. sort an almost stored array\n",
    "6. Kth largest element in array"
